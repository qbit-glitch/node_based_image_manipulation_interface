## Lines (448 - 451)

These lines are setting up texture parameters in OpenGL, which are used to control how textures are sampled and displayed. Let me break down each line:

1. **Minification Filter**:
```cpp
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
```
- This controls how the texture is sampled when it's displayed smaller than its original size (minification)
- `GL_LINEAR` means it will use bilinear interpolation to create a smooth, blended result
- Alternative would be `GL_NEAREST` which would use the nearest texel without blending

2. **Magnification Filter**:
```cpp
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
```
- This controls how the texture is sampled when it's displayed larger than its original size (magnification)
- Again, `GL_LINEAR` provides smooth interpolation
- For pixel art or when you want a crisp, pixelated look, you might use `GL_NEAREST`

3. **Texture Wrapping (S coordinate)**:
```cpp
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
```
- Controls what happens when texture coordinates go beyond the [0,1] range in the horizontal direction (S coordinate)
- `GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE` means it will use the edge color when sampling outside the texture
- Other options include `GL_REPEAT` (tiles the texture) or `GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT` (tiles with mirroring)

4. **Texture Wrapping (T coordinate)**:
```cpp
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
```
- Same as above but for the vertical direction (T coordinate)
- In this case, both S and T are set to `GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE`, which is common for image processing applications

In the context of this image editor application, these settings are important because:
1. They ensure smooth scaling of images when displayed at different sizes
2. They prevent texture tiling (which would be undesirable for image editing)
3. They handle edge cases properly when sampling near texture boundaries
4. They provide high-quality texture filtering for better visual results

These parameters are typically set when creating or updating an OpenGL texture, which in this case is used to display the image being edited in the GUI.
